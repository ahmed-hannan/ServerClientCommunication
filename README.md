# ServerClientCommunication
Made a recreation of a server client communication using terminals in ubuntu

Forks into different terminals so they can be used to model a client communicating with a group or a server and vice versa
Clients can message clients and or group.
Server can message and any client, and can be messaged by any client aswell
